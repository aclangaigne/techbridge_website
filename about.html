            <p>Introducing Abigail Langaigne, the driving force behind Tech Bridge. Growing up, Abigail navigated her entire K-12 journey without access to computer science or tech courses. Yet, rather than succumb to this limitation, she turned it into a catalyst for change. Fueled by a deep-seated desire to level the playing field, Abigail founded Tech Bridge with a singular mission: to empower students in underserved communities.</p>
            <p>Her personal experiences fuel her empathy and determination to make a difference. Abigail understands the struggles faced by young minds in neighborhoods like the one she grew up in, and she's committed to ensuring they have the opportunities she didn't. With Tech Bridge, she's creating pathways for success, breaking down barriers to tech education one school at a time.</p>
            <p>Abigail's vision extends far beyond merely teaching code; it's about unlocking potential and fostering innovation in communities often overlooked. Her leadership inspires others to join the cause, rallying support from educators, businesses, and advocates alike.</p>
            <p>Through Tech Bridge, Abigail's legacy is one of hope, resilience, and unwavering dedication. Together, let's stand with Abigail as she champions a brighter future for all, where every child has the chance to thrive in the digital age.</p>
